#  BMW Car Sales Analysis

## 📌 Project Description

This project explores BMW car sales using **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** techniques. The dataset includes vehicle specifications such as model, year, region, fuel type, engine size, mileage, price, and a sales classification (High or Low).  
Instead of building a predictive model, this analysis uncovers patterns and relationships that may explain why certain BMW models sell better than others.

### ❓ Problem Statement
What factors are associated with high or low sales of BMW car models?

The goal is to support **automotive businesses or dealerships** in making informed decisions about:
- Inventory management
- Product strategy
- Market expansion

## 💡 Key Insights (For Automotive Businesses or Dealerships)

### 1. **Top-Selling Models**
- **BMW 7 Series**, **i8**, and **X1** are the most in-demand models.
- **Recommendation:** Focus inventory and promotions on these lines to maximise sales turnover.

### 2. **Regional Market Strength**
- **Asia and Europe** lead in total sales.
- **Recommendation:** Allocate more stock and marketing efforts here for better ROI.
- South America and Africa show potential for more growth strategies.

### 3. **Fuel Type Preferences**
- **Hybrid** vehicles dominate sales, followed by **Petrol**.
- **Electric** shows rising demand.
- **Diesel** lags, likely due to environmental concerns.
- **Recommendation:** Diversify inventory with stronger focus on Hybrids and EVs.

### 4. **Transmission Trends**
- **Manual transmissions** slightly outperform automatics.
- **Recommendation:** Offer both types based on market/region.

### 5. **Yearly Sales Trend**
- **2022** was the peak year — possibly due to launches or campaigns.
- **2023** had the lowest sales — may reflect supply issues or market fatigue.
- **Recommendation:** Learn from highs, investigate lows.

### 6. **Mileage, Price, and Engine Size**
- No strong correlation with sales classification.
- **Recommendation:** Rather than lowering prices or tweaking specs, focus on:
  - Brand positioning
  - Targeting the right markets
  - Enhancing the customer experience
